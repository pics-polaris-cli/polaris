# Kubernetes Testbed

This folder contains setup instructions for setting up a Kubernetes cluster for use with Polaris.

Our guide uses [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io), but other Kubernetes distributions can, of course, be used as well.
To set up and prepare your Kubernetes cluster, execute the [base](./microk8s/base/) setup.
Afterwards you can start developing or [deploying](https://polaris-slo-cloud.github.io/polaris-slo-framework/deployment/) the Polaris controllers.

The other folders in the [microk8s](./microk8s/) directory contain some testbed applications.
